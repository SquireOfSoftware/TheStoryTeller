# TheStoryTeller

The goal is to provide some sort of API that you can interact with, you submit to this system the decisions that you have taken and the outcomes of those decisions.

== 9/3/2017 ==

The first step is to go with user stories, I guess to explore the different types of things that I want the system to build upon.

The eventual goal is some sort of API or REST API or something that I can submit decisions that I decide to as well as the consequences to.

Decisions need specific ids. From these ids, consequences and decisions can be derived from.

An example quest:

Scout (but do not engage) a warlord
===================================

Quest description: 

- observe an orc warlord from 5pm to 6pm (in game time) and live

- issued out by intelligence guild

Success conditions:

- orc warlord does not recognise anything suspicious (this needs to be defined)

- you are still alive

- was able to be in the observable proximity (to be defined) of the orc warlord presence

Immediate decisions:

- Accept the quest

- Reject the quest - also ignore the quest as well
