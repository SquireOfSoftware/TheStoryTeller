# TheStoryTeller

The goal is to provide some sort of API that you can interact with, you submit to this system the decisions that you have taken and the outcomes of those decisions.

== 9/3/2017 ==

The first step is to go with user stories, I guess to explore the different types of things that I want the system to build upon.

The eventual goal is some sort of API or REST API or something that I can submit decisions that I decide to as well as the consequences to.

Decisions need specific ids. From these ids, consequences and decisions can be derived from.

An example quest:

- Capture 20 butterflies

Decisions: Accept/Reject

Accept - you are now actively participating in the removal of 20 butterflies

Reject - nothing is done to the butterfly population

Questions: 

- Is there a time limit?

- Who requested this quest? Is this person the same person that gives you the reward?

Consequences:

- Regardless of things, it will add your decisions to the action log to be used later for future quests

- Accept:

1. Succeeding - there is 20 less butterflies in the world

Effects: 

- may have an impact on the economy

- may reduce the likeliness that this quest appears again

2. Failure - nothing is done about the butterflies

- 

- Reject

1. Could have an impact on your reputation 

- either stingy or known for not taking easy quests
